				<p>
				Vin: This is the input voltage pin of the Arduino board used to provide input supply from an external power source.<br><br>

5V: This pin of the Arduino board is used as a regulated power supply voltage and it is used to give supply to the board as well as onboard components.<br><br>

3.3V: This pin of the board is used to provide a supply of 3.3V which is generated from a voltage regulator on the board<br><br>

GND: This pin of the board is used to ground the Arduino board.<br><br>

Reset: This pin of the board is used to reset the microcontroller. It is used to Resets the microcontroller.<br><br>

Analog Pins: The pins A0 to A11 are used as an analog input and it is in the range of 0-5V.<br><br>

Digital Pins: The pins 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 are used as a digital input or output for the Arduino board.<br><br>

Serial Pins: This pin is also known as a UART pin. It is used for communication between the Arduino board and a computer or other devices. The transmitter pin number 1 and receiver pin number 0 is used to transmit and receive the data resp.<br><br>

External Interrupt Pins: This pin of the Arduino board is used to produce the External interrupt and it is done by pin numbers 2 and 3.<br><br>

I2C:  This pin of the board is used for I2C communication. <br><br>

Pin number 2 signifies Serial Data Line (SDA)and it is used for holding the data.<br><br>
Pin number 3 signifies Serial Clock Line (SCL) and it is used for offering data synchronization among the devices.<br><br>
LED Pin:  The board has an inbuilt LED using digital pin-13. The LED glows only when the digital pin becomes high.<br><br>

AREF Pin: This is an analog reference pin of the Arduino board. It is used to provide a reference voltage from an external power supply.<br><br>
